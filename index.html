Phishing is a scam performed by using deceptive emails and false identities in order to obtain personal information such as credit cards, personal information, and passwords. Flaming is sending messages over the internet using profanity, insults, and offensive messages. Spamming on the other hand, is receiving or sending dozens of unsolicited emails.
The difference between flaming and phishing is that one is cybercrime and the other is cyberbullying. Really the only difference is their objective. Spamming is often used by different services in order to promote their product, meanwhile flaming are hateful messages with the intention of hurting the receiver. A similarity between the two is that they are both unsolicited.
